# Nmap Basic Port Scans
## TCP and UDP Ports
* Identify network services running on target.
  * Services include providing time, responding to DNS queries, serving web pages.
* Only one service can listen on any TCP or UDP port (on the same IP address).
  * HTTP server binds to TCP/80 by default.
    * If HTTP server supports SSL/TLS it listens on TCP/443.
* Ports are classified in two states.
1. Open port indicates that there is a service listening on that port.
2. Closed port indicates that there is no service listening on that port.
* Consider the impact of firewalls.
  * Port might be open but firewall blocks packets.
* Nmap considers six states due to firewall filtering.
    
| State | Meaning
| --- | ---
| Open | A service is listening on the specified port.
| Closed | No service is listening on the specified port although the port is accessible.  Port is reachable and is not blocked by a firewall or other security appliances/programs.
| Filtered | Nmap cannot determine if the port is open or closed because the port is not accessible.  Usually due to a firewall preventing Nmap from reaching that port.
| Unfiltered | Nmap cannot determine if the port is open or closed although the port is accessible. This state is encountered when using an ACK scan `-sA`.
| Open or Filtered | Nmap cannot determine whether the port is open or filtered.
| Closed or Filtered | Nmap cannot decide whether a port is closed or filtered.

## TCP Flags
* TCP header is first 24 bytes of TCP segment.
* TCP header defined in [RFC 793](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc793.html).

![TCP Header](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Ntwk_tcp_header123.jpg?20091215232927)

* Each row has 32 bits (4 bytes) allocated with six rows total making up 24 bytes.
* First row is source TCP port number and the destination port number.
  * Port number is allocated 16 bits (2 bytes).
* Second and third rows are sequence number and acknowledgement number.
* Setting a flag bit means setting its value to 1.
* TCP header flags.

| Flag | Function
| --- | ---
| URG | Urgent flag indicates that the urgent pointer filed is significant. Urgent pointer indicates that the incoming data is urgent and that a TCP segment with the URG flag set is processed immediately without consideration of having to wait on previously sent TCP segments.
| ACK | Acknowledgement flag indicates that the acknowledgement number is significant. Used to acknowledge the receipt of a TCP segment.
| PSH | Push flag asks TCP to pass the data to the application promptly.
| RST | Reset flag is used to reset the connection.  Another device such as a firewall may send a Reset to tear a TCP connection. Also used when data is sent to a host and there is no service on the receiving end to answer.
| SYN | Synchronise flag is used to initiate a TCP 3-way handshake and synchronise sequence numbers with the other host. Sequence number should be set randomly during TCP connection establishment.
| FIN | The sender has no more data to send.

## TCP Connect Scan
* Run using `-sT`.
* Completes TCP 3-way handshake.
* Connection is torn as soon as state is confirmed by sending a RST/ACK.
* TCP connect scan is the only possible option to discover open TCP ports if Nmap is not run as a privileged user (`root` or `sudoer`).
* Nmap will attempt to connect to the 1000 most common ports by default.
* Closed ports respond to SYN packet with RST/ACK.

  * `-F` enables fast mode and decreases number of scanned ports from 1000 to 100 most common ports.
  * `-r` scans ports in consecutive order instead of random order.
    * Useful when testing whether ports open in consistent manner.
    * E.g. when a target boots up.

## TCP SYN (Stealth) Scan
* Run using `-sS`.
  * Unprivileged users limited to TCP connect scans.
* Default scan mode for a privileged (root or sudoer).
* Does not need to complete TCP 3-way handshake.
  * RST packet sent once a SYN/ACK packet received from target.
    * Decreases the chances of the scan being logged because we didnâ€™t establish a TCP connection.

## UDP Scan
* Run using `-sU`.
* Connectionless protocol.
  * Does not require any handshake for connection establishment.
* Cannot guarantee that a service listening on a UDP port would respond to Nmap packets.
* Cannot expect any reply if UDP packet is sent to an open UDP port.
  * UDP ports that do not generate any response are those that Nmap will state as open.
* ICMP packet type 3, destination unreachable, and code 3, port unreachable is returned if UDP packet sent to a closed port.

## Fine-Tuning Scope and Performance
* Specify the ports to scan instead of the default 1000 ports.
  * port list: `-p22,80,443`.
  * port range: `-p1-1023` will scan all ports between 1 and 1023 inclusive.
    * `-p20-25` will scan ports between 20 and 25 inclusive.
* Scan of all 65535 ports using `-p-`.
* Scan the most common 100 ports using `-F`.
* `--top-ports 10` will check the ten most common ports.
* Control the scan timing using `-T<0-5>`.
  * Six scan timing templates available.

| Timing | Usage
| --- | ---
| Paranoid (0) | `-T0` scans one port at a time and waits 5 minutes between sending each probe. Use to avoid IDs alerts.
| Sneaky (1) | Often used during real engagements where stealth is important. Use to avoid IDS alerts.
| Polite (2) |
| Normal (3) | Default timing.
| Aggressive (4) | Often used during CTFs and when learning to scan on practice targets.
| Insane (5) |  Can affect the accuracy of the scan results due to the increased likelihood of packet loss.

* Control packet rate using `--min-rate <number>` or `--max-rate <number>`.
  * `--max-rate 10` or `--max-rate=10` ensures that scanner is not sending more than ten packets per second.
* Control probing parallelisation using `--min-parallelism <numprobes>` or `--max-parallelism <numprobes>`.
  * Nmap probes targets to discover which hosts are live and which ports are open.
    * Probing parallelisation specifies number of such probes that can be run in parallel.
  * `--min-parallelism=512` pushes Nmap to maintain at least 512 probes in parallel.
