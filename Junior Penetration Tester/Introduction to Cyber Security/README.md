* Process of breaking into computer systems, exploiting software bugs, and finding loopholes in applications to gain unauthorised access to them.
* To beat a hacker, you need to behave like a hacker, finding vulnerabilities and recommending patches before a cybercriminal does.
##Hack your first machine
